RC5 CRYPTO ENGINE GENERATOR IN PERL

Project Description

RC5 is a block cipher invented by Ron Rivest at MIT. It has a variable block size 
(32, 64 or 128 bits), key size (0 to 2040 bits) and number of rounds (0 to 255).  
A key feature of RC5 is the use of data-dependent rotations; one of the goals of 
RC5 was to prompt the study and evaluation of such operations as a cryptographic 
primitive. (Refer to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC5 for further information.)

This CodePlex project presents a Perl script that generates VHDL code for RC5 
encryption and decryption engines. The script asks for desired block size, number 
of rounds and key size, and then generate a complete set of VHDL files (including 
the test benches) that implement the block cipher. The VHDL code is fully  
synthesizable. The architecture of both encryptor and decryptor are pipelined.
